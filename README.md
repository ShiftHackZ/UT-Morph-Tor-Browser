# Morph Tor Browser

A fork of [Morph Browser](https://gitlab.com/ubports/development/core/morph-browser).

Lightweight web browser tailored for Ubuntu Touch, based on the Qt WebEngine
and using the Lomiri UI components.

## Building

The build system uses cmake. Please see debian/control for the complete list of
build requirements.  To compile, simply invoke cmake and then make:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The application can also be cross compiled for an ARM target on a X86 host.
To do that, just pass this additional parameter to cmake:

```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/ubuntu-arm-linux-gnueabihf.cmake .
```

### Building for Ubuntu Touch

Use the [clickable](https://clickable-ut.dev/en/latest/) command line tool:

```sh
clickable clean && clickable build --arch=arm64
```

### Build with docker

First we need to build the image

```sh
docker build -t ubports_xenial .
```

Then we can build the app

```sh
docker run --privileged -ti --rm -e DISPLAY=:0 -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v `pwd`:/home/developer/ubports_build ubports_xenial bash -c "cmake . && make"
```

Now we can run the app

```sh
docker run --privileged -ti --rm -e DISPLAY=:0 -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v `pwd`:/home/developer/ubports_build ubports_xenial bash -c "./src/app/webbrowser/webbrowser-app"
```

## Running

webbrowser-app can be run from the development branch without the need to
install any files. Just run:

```sh
./src/app/webbrowser/webbrowser-app
```

The executable accepts command line switches and parameters. To find out which,
just run:

```sh
./src/app/webbrowser/webbrowser-app --help
```

## Unit tests

To run the unit tests, you can use the commands below:

```sh
make test
# or
ctest
```

## Tests

**NOTE**: autopilot is currently not available in UBports and the instructions
below are no longer accurate.

### Automated UI tests

webbrowser-app uses [autopilot](https://launchpad.net/autopilot) to test its UI.
To run the tests locally, you will need to install python3-autopilot and
autopilot-qt5.
Then do the following:

```sh
cd tests/autopilot/
autopilot3 run webbrowser_app
```

You can get a list of all available tests with the following command:

```sh
autopilot3 list webbrowser_app
```

In order to run the tests in a virtual machine with an environment closer to
what a user will get in Ubuntu Touch, see the Dep8 tests section.

### Code coverage

To generate a report with detailed code coverage, you need to re-run cmake with
`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=coverage`:

```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=coverage .
make
make test
make coverage
```

This will generate a coverage report in XML format (coverage.xml) and an
interactive human-readable report in HTML format (coveragereport/index.html).

### Dep8 tests

Dep8 tests exercise the package "as-installed".

Currently, the webbrowser-app has one suite of dep8 tests that uses
[autopilot](https://launchpad.net/autopilot) to test from the point of view of
the user.

To run the tests you will need autopkgtest:

```sh
sudo apt-get install autopkgtest
```

You can use multiple test beds to execute the tests. Below you will find
instructions to run them in a virtual machine
You can find more information with:

```sh
man adt-run
```

#### Run dep8 tests

To run the tests in a qemu virtual machine, you will first have to create it
(see /usr/share/doc/autopkgtest/README.running-tests.rst.gz). We output the
image to ~/ rather than the current directory, so it will be in a safer
place to avoid rebuilding images every time. You can store it in any
directory you wish. This image is better consumed "fresh", building it daily
will avoid long updates/upgrades when running the tests.

```sh
adt-buildvm-ubuntu-cloud -r $(lsb_release -c -s) -a amd64 -o ~/
```

Then run the tests using adt-run with the qemu virtualization host against
the current archive.

```sh
adt-run -B -U --unbuilt-tree . \
  -o ~/adt-browser-test/$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M) \
  --- qemu ~/adt-$(lsb_release -c -s)-amd64-cloud.img
```

The tests can also be run on a local phone.

```sh
adt-run -B -U --unbuilt-tree . \
  -o ~/adt-browser-test/$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M) \
  --- ssh -s adb -- -p <password> --serial <ADB_SERIAL>
```

#### Examine the dep8 autopilot results

To examine the test results, which are in subunit format, additional tools are
required, such as [trv](https://launchpad.net/trv).

You can find the results file in the directory
`~/adt-browser-test/$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M)/artifacts`.

## Settings

webbrowser-app supports a limited set of custom settings, persisted on disk in
the following INI-like file: `$HOME/.config/webbrowser-app/webbrowser-app.conf`

The following keys are supported:

- `homepage`: a URL that the browser will open when launched if no URL is
  specified on the command line

- `searchengine`: a custom search engine specification, looked up in
  $HOME/.local/share/webbrowser-app/searchengines/{value}.xml and following
  the [OpenSearch document description format](http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/1.1)

- `restoreSession`: whether to restore the previous browsing session at startup
  (defaults to true)
